### Assignments and Collaboration

We encourage vigorous discussion and cooperation in this class. You should feel free to discuss any aspects of the class with any classmates and review your classmates progress and achievements. However, we insist that any coded material that is not specifically designated as a Team Deliverable be done by you alone. This includes individual reports associated with assignments, and course project assignments. We also insist that if you include verbatim text from any source, you clearly indicate it using standard conventions of quotation or indentation and a note to indicate the source. Moreover, we would like you to pay attention and respect all licensing policies of third-party software that you will use in your assignments and course project.
